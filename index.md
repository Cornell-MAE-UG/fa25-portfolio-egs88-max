## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University passionate about applying physics, materials science, and hands-on design to real-world performance challenges. Whether optimizing ski edges for speed, maintaining a fleet of over 100 sailboats as a waterfront operations lead, or designing mechanisms for environmental efficiency, I approach engineering as both an analytical and creative process. My academic focus on applied mechanics, dynamics, and materials design complements my experiential background in outdoor engineering — from hydrodynamics in sailing to mechanical performance in skiing. I thrive on solving complex problems through collaboration, experimentation, and data-driven design, and I’m eager to continue developing systems that merge technical precision with environmental responsibility.
