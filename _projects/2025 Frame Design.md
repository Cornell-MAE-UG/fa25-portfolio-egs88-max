For a class, we were asked to select a linear actuator from a catalog (image inserted below) based on max force values. Then, given a design space of 50cm by 150cm we had to design a frame to lift the maximum possible weight to the maximum possible height. The design conditions for the frame were that you had a rigid bar of your choice of length, the actuator, and three pin supports, 2 of which were required to be connected to the floor.

Here is my work from the assignment:
